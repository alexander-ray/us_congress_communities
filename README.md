# us_congress_communities
Repository for the code of an analysis on communities in congressional cosponsorship networks. The main branch contains most of the basic data collection code (`scraper.py`, `data_parser.py`), analysis code (`analysis.py`), and some very scattered plotting code (`plotting.py`). Additional helper code exists throughout (`NMI.py`, `plotting_setup.py`). The bill analysis branch includes additional code used for work on modularity with different legislative subjects as well as some statistical analyses.

The majority of the data used for this analysis exists [here](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/congressional-data-bulk-legislation-bills) and [here](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators). `scraper.py` contains code to collect amendment cosponsorship data.
